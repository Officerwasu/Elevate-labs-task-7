## Extensions Found

Here are the extensions currently installed in Firefox:

| Extension Name              | Description                                              | Safe? | Action Taken |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------------|
| **FoxyProxy**              | Advanced proxy management tool for switching servers     | ✅    | Kept         |
| **Privacy Badger**         | Blocks trackers and enhances privacy                     | ✅    | Kept         |
| **Wappalyzer**             | Profiles website technologies (useful for developers)    | ✅    | Kept         |

All three extensions were reviewed thoroughly and deemed safe. None of them had suspicious permissions, unknown developers, or negative reputations.

## Steps Followed

1. Opened Firefox `about:addons` page.
2. Reviewed all installed extensions.
3. Verified the developer, reviews, and permissions for each extension.
4. Confirmed no unnecessary or suspicious extensions were present.
5. Restarted the browser to check for performance.

## Key Learnings

- Some extensions ask for broad permissions — it’s essential to verify why.
- Open-source and well-reviewed tools (like Privacy Badger and FoxyProxy) are generally safe when installed from official sources.
- Even useful extensions can become risky if they are sold to malicious developers later.
- Keeping only essential extensions helps minimize the attack surface.

## Conclusion

No suspicious extensions were found. All installed add-ons are privacy-oriented and security-vetted.

 **Task Completed Successfully.**
